## CF Calendar

The CF Calendar plugin creates a calendar page under the Posts section of the navigation.  This calendar will automatically display Published/Draft/Pending posts in the calendar.  The calendar layout is designed to show every day of the month being displayed.  Days will be added on the beginning and end from the previous and next months as needed to fill the table formatting.

### Post Type Hiding

A key has been added to the top of the calendar that displays the color coding for each post type, and also a show/hide link.  The show/hide link will hide and show the posts for the selected post type on the calendar.  This only applies to the master calendar view and the hiding will be removed upon page reload or navigating to a new page.

### Navigation

Navigation has been added to the calendar for easy moving between months.  At the top left of the calendar a link has been added for Today.  This link will bring the browser back to the current month.  In the top middle of the calendar, the month being displayed is shown.  At the top right of the calendar, two different types of navigation have been added.  A drop down box is in place for directly selecting a month.  Only months with posts in them will be displayed in the drop down list.  Once a month is selected from the drop down, the browser will automatically be directed to that month.  Also navigation has been added to navigate to the previous and next months.  The buttons with << and >> go to the previous and next months respectively.  A Today button has also been added to go directly to the current month.

### Day Layout

Each day will display the posts for that particular day.  The list of posts displayed is based entirely upon post time.  The posts with a date later in the day will always show up higher than the posts with a date earlier in the day.  The day will automatically display 6 posts in the day, then a More link will be added.

The posts displayed in the day will display the post title and a pencil link.  When a user clicks on the post title, a light box window will display with more information about the post.  When a user clicks on the pencil link, they will be directed automatically to the post edit screen for the post selected.

The more link, as well as the double paper link next to the day number, will pop open a new light box window that will display more information about the day.  This box will display every post for the day selected.  The list of posts will display the post title and a pencil link.  When a user clicks on the title of the post, the current light box window will close and another one will open with information about the post clicked.  If the user clicks on the pencil link, they will be directed automatically to the post edit screen for the post selected.

The plus button, added to each day, gives users the ability to create new posts with a scheduled date for the date selected.  When clicked this button will direct the browser to the New Post screen and automatically set the publish date to the date selected.

### Post Layout

The post layout light box will display information about the post.  Information included with posts is Author, Category, Status, Publish Date, Last Modified and Word Count.  An Edit link has been added to the post information screen for easy linking directly to the post edit screen.
