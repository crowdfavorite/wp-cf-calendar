## CF Calendar Readme

The CF Calendar plugin displays a calendar on a WordPress admin screen.  This calendar will display a list of posts for each day.  The list will be 6 items long, and will display a more link if there are more than 6 items.  The more link when clicked will open a popup window that will display all of the posts for that day.  That functionality is replicated by the double page icon in the day title section.  When the post title is clicked it will display the Post information in a popup window.  Navigation is available to select a specific month to display from a drop down, and links for previous, next and this month.  The drop down list will display any month that has posts in it.
